1. What is the difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Online Service?
Power BI Desktop is a free Windows application used to create reports, build data models, and write DAX.

Power BI Online Service (app.powerbi.com) is a cloud-based platform used for publishing, sharing, collaborating, and consuming reports and dashboards.

2. How do you publish a Power BI report from Desktop to the Online Service?

In Power BI Desktop, click Home > Publish, sign in with your Power BI account, and select the workspace where you want to publish.

The report and its associated dataset are uploaded to the Power BI Service.

3. What is a workspace in Power BI? What are the types of workspaces available?

A workspace is a collaborative area in Power BI Service where users can publish, share, and manage content.

Types:

My Workspace – personal space, private to the user.

Shared Workspaces – for teams, collaboration, and app publishing.

4. What is the difference between a workspace and an app in Power BI?

A workspace is a development and collaboration area for creating and managing content.

An app is a read-only packaged version of reports/dashboards, published from a workspace and shared with users for consumption.

5. Explain the different Power BI license types and their limitations.
License	Features	Limitations
Free	Build reports in Desktop	Cannot share or publish to workspaces
Pro	Publish, share, collaborate, RLS	Limited to Pro users or Premium workspaces
Premium Per User (PPU)	All Pro features + AI + large models	Needs PPU licenses for both creators & consumers
Premium Capacity	Dedicated cloud capacity for org-wide sharing	Expensive, but enables sharing with Free users
6. How can you share a report with someone who doesn’t have a Pro license?

Place the report in a Premium workspace (backed by Premium capacity).

Users with a Free license can then view the report without needing Pro.

7. What is a semantic model (dataset) in Power BI, and where is it stored in the service?

A semantic model (previously called a dataset) is the data model containing tables, relationships, measures, and queries.

It is stored in the workspace where the report was published and can be reused in other reports.

8. How does Scheduled Refresh work in Power BI Online Service?

Scheduled refresh automatically updates the dataset at set intervals (e.g., daily/hourly).

You configure it in the Dataset Settings in Power BI Service.

Gateway may be required for on-premises data sources.

9. What is the difference between a dataset and a dataflow in Power BI?
Term	Description
Dataset	Model + data + DAX used by a report
Dataflow	Reusable ETL logic stored in cloud, creates tables using Power Query
10. When and why would you use a dataflow instead of a dataset?

Use dataflows when:

You want to centralize ETL logic across multiple datasets.

You’re managing large-scale data prep with reusable tables.

You want to store cleaned data in the cloud (using Azure Data Lake Gen2).

11. What are dashboards in Power BI Online? How are they different from reports?
Feature	Dashboard	Report
View Type	Single-page summary	Multi-page with visuals
Source	Pinned visuals from reports	Built in Power BI Desktop
Interaction	Limited filters, real-time tiles	Fully interactive
Use Case	KPI summary, executive overview	Detailed analysis
12. How do you pin a visual to a dashboard from a report?

Open a report in Power BI Service.

Hover over a visual → Click the "Pin" icon → Choose to pin to existing or new dashboard.

13. What is the mobile view in Power BI and why is it useful?

Mobile view customizes how a report or dashboard appears on smartphones or tablets.

Useful for ensuring that content is readable and usable on smaller screens.

14. What is a paginated report in Power BI and when would you use it?

Paginated reports are pixel-perfect, printable reports (like invoices, bills).

Use when:

You need precise layout.

You want to export/print multiple pages.

You’re working with large tabular data.

Requires Power BI Report Builder to design, and Premium/PPU to publish.

15. Can you export reports from Power BI Service to PDF or PowerPoint? How?

Yes. In the report toolbar (in Service), go to:

File > Export > PDF

File > Export > PowerPoint

These exports are static (not interactive).

16. What does “Live Connection” mean in Power BI Service, and how does it work?

Live Connection allows a report to connect directly to a dataset or model (like SSAS or another Power BI dataset).

The data remains in the source; only queries are sent.

Benefits: real-time access, no data duplication.

17. Explain Row-Level Security (RLS) and how it’s applied in Power BI Online.

RLS restricts data visibility based on the user’s role.

You define roles and filters in Power BI Desktop.

In Power BI Service:

Go to Dataset > Security.

Assign users to the roles.

RLS works only for Pro or Premium users.

18. How can you test RLS roles in Power BI Service?

Go to the Dataset > Security in Power BI Service.

Click on a role and select “Test as role” to simulate the report as if you're that user.

19. What are Apps in Power BI and how do you publish one?

A Power BI App is a bundled collection of dashboards, reports, and datasets, published from a workspace.

To publish:

Go to workspace

Click “Publish App”

Set permissions, navigation, and audience

Click Publish

20. What are some key benefits of using the Power BI Online Service in enterprise environments?

Centralized sharing and collaboration

Secure data access with RLS and Azure AD

Scheduled data refreshes

Scalable Premium capacity

Apps for packaging and distributing content

Integration with Teams, Excel, SharePoint, and more

Usage metrics and audit logs for governance
