1. How does Power BI handle large datasets in the Online Service, and what is the role of Premium Capacity in this?
Power BI Pro limits datasets to 1 GB and 8 refreshes/day.
Power BI Premium supports:
Datasets up to 400 GB (compressed).
Up to 48 refreshes/day.
Incremental refresh for performance.
Dedicated resources for better performance.

2. What are the differences between Import mode, DirectQuery, and Live Connection in Power BI Service?
Import Mode:
Data is stored in Power BI.
Fast performance.
Requires refresh.
DirectQuery:
Data queried in real-time from the source.
Up-to-date data.
Slower performance and limited DAX.
Live Connection:
Connects to a model (e.g., SSAS, Power BI Dataset).
No local model, real-time.
Modeling is done at the source.

3. Explain deployment pipelines in Power BI Online. What stages do they include?
Used for managing content lifecycle.
Includes 3 stages:
Development
Test
Production
Automates and controls publishing, testing, and promotion.
Requires Premium or PPU.

4. How can Power BI Service integrate with Microsoft Teams or SharePoint for collaboration?
Teams Integration:
Embed reports in tabs.
Comment and chat in context.
Use Power BI app inside Teams.
SharePoint Integration:
Use Power BI web part in SharePoint Online.
Securely embed reports for internal users.

5. What is the XMLA endpoint in Premium and how does it benefit developers or enterprise BI teams?
XMLA endpoint allows external tools to connect to datasets.
Enables:
Advanced modeling (Tabular Editor, SSMS).
CI/CD workflows.
Metadata scripting and version control.
Only in Premium or PPU workspaces.

6. Describe how usage metrics and audit logs work in Power BI Service.
Usage Metrics:
Built-in reports on views, usage, and sharing.
Available for reports and dashboards.
Audit Logs:
Accessed via Microsoft 365/Azure.
Track activities like share, export, view, delete.
Used for compliance and monitoring.

7. How do you manage workspace access and permissions for different users?
Assign workspace roles:
Admin – Full control.
Member – Edit all content.
Contributor – Add/edit content.
Viewer – View only.
Manage under Workspace → Settings → Permissions.

8. How can data governance be enforced in Power BI Service?
Use:
Certified and Promoted datasets.
Sensitivity labels (Microsoft Purview).
Data loss prevention (DLP) policies.
Audit logs and activity monitoring.
Role-based access control (RBAC).
Naming conventions and metadata standards.

9. What are the limitations of Row-Level Security when using DirectQuery or Live Connection?
DirectQuery:
RLS supported but may reduce performance.
Some sources may not support RLS efficiently.
Live Connection:
RLS must be defined in the source model.
Cannot define RLS in the report itself.

10. Explain how you can refresh a dataset via Power Automate or REST API.
Power Automate:
Use “Refresh a dataset” action.
Trigger manually, on schedule, or based on events.
REST API:
Use POST /datasets/{datasetId}/refreshes.
Requires Azure AD auth and workspace access.
Supports automation and custom workflows.
